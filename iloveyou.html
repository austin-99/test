            Just kidding, I did have a love song for you. When I heard 
            this song in 2015,<br>
            I couldn't wait for the day I share it 
            with someone special. Listen carefully because <br>
            I mean every word of it.

            <p>You lift my heart up<br>
                When the rest of me is down<br>
                You, you enchant me, even when you're not around<br>
                If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down<br>
                I'm latching on babe<br>
                Now I know what I have found<br>
                I feel we're close enough<br>
                Could I lock in your love?<br>
                I feel we're close enough<br>
                Could I lock in your love?<br>
                Now I got you in my space<br>
                I won't let go of you<br>
                Got you shackled in my embrace<br>
                I'm latching on to you<br>
                I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch<br>
                Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch<br>
                How do you do it, you got me losing every breath<br>
                What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?<br>
                I feel we're close enough<br>
                Could lock in your love<br>
                I feel we're close enough<br>
